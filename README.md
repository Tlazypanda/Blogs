## What it is?

SOHW is an open project seeks to bring the culture of openness among people, to come forward and share their technical skills with diverse set of people. The project is designed to guide people who joined the web with keen interest to update themselves towards the current trend by learning or to develop something for the betterment of the web.

*Note: This project is being developed under the Mozilla Open Leadership Program, Round 5 and mentored by [Pranshu Khanna](). We used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with github to develop your website*

## Why does this project exist?

*	Newcomers always find it difficult and suffers from where to start
*	Lack of information on opportunities available in web
*	Many advance resource materials are complex for newcomers to understand
*	Lack of resources at beginner level
*	Don’t know whom to approach in the case of doubt

## What we plan for it?

*	We offer a collection of resources that are free, open and remixable
*	Newcomers can get guidance directly from the author of the resource or with their team easily
*	We help newcomers to come out with flying colors
*	Collaborating people with different technical background to share and learn their knowledge

## How are we doing it?

We are developing a website where volunteers can share their resources in any field they are specialized in and where a newcomer can find and use the available resource to learn. SOHW helps to collaborate people with different technical background and allow them to crack a better solution for a problem in this open space. If any wants to develop a project, then he/she can get a group of curious people here and newcomers can join as a volunteer in any open projects. We always eager to hear the problems of newcomer and will guide them individually to make them shine in a tech field. 

### Volunteers
