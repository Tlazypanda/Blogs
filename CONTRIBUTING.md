## Participation Guidelines 

This project adheres to a [Mozilla Community Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to fahimazulfath[dot]a[at]gmail[dot]com.

## How can I contribute
To contribute for SOHW, you always required a [GitHub account](https://github.com/). New to GitHub or contributing to open source for the first time? Check this small *free* course, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github). Each series take only 2-3 mins and you will find this useful.

We know even before you start contributing that getting set up, to work on SOHW and finding a bug that's a good fit for your skills, can be a challenge. Go through our repo and the process going on. If you find anything weird, report it to us. We are determined to solve hurdles all around to make you people comfortable.

### Reporting Bugs
Bugs are tracked as GitHub [issues](https://github.com/SOHW/Blogs/issues/). We always say it as a friendly suggestions from your side for our improvements. A huge appreciation for you, since you are caring for us. 😍😇

When you create an issue, please provide the following information by filling in the template.

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. Don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used a mouse or a keyboard.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets on the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

### Labels 

You can find all currently open conversations under the [issues tab](https://github.com/SOHW/Blogs/issues). The current list of labels are [here](https://github.com/SOHW/Blogs/labels) and link the apt label while you create an issue.

### Fixing the bug/ working on issues
Bugs listed as ``Assigned`` are not usually a good place to start, unless you're sure you have something worthy to contribute. Someone else is already working on it! Even with no assignee, it is polite to check if someone has recently commented that they're looking at fixing the issue.

Once you have found something to work on, go ahead and comment! Let the bug submitter, reviewer, and component owner know that you'd like to work on the bug. You might receive some extra information, perhaps also made the assignee.

### Fork the Repository

**[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit and use.
**[Make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)**! You can do this in the GitHub interface on your own local machine. Once you're happy with your changes.
 
Once you have made all your changes, tests, and updated the documentation, make a pull request to move everything back into the main branch of the `repository`. Be sure to reference the original issue in the pull request. Expect some back-and-forth with regards to style and compliance of these rules. If you are contributing for an issue, then please add the issue number in the comment while sending us a pull request.
 
 ### Make the Pull Request

**Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)**. This opens a discussion around your project and lets the project lead know you are proposing changes.

Be sure to add the relevant tests before making the pull request. Docs will be updated automatically when we merge to `master`, but you should also build the docs yourself and make sure they're readable.
